SmartGrid Canada was the premiere Canadian event for SmartGrid, an annual conference held in Toronto that convened top executives from all major Canadian utilities (e.g., Ontario Hydro, BC Hydro), key political figures, and major corporate players like Siemens, ABB, Schneider Electric, IBM, and Cisco â€“ most of whom were also sponsors.

Across the 2011, 2012, and 2013 editions, this event served as a critical platform for advancing smart grid initiatives and fostering high-level collaboration within the Canadian energy sector. We held the event in 3 locations, the Toronto Direct Energy Center, the Hilton Hotel, and the Mars Discovery District over the 3 year run.
