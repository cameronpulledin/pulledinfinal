The VR/AR Global Summit (Europa) was a testament to rapid adaptation and innovation amidst unprecedented global lockdowns. Originally planned as an in-person launch in Lisbon for 800 attendees, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an astonishing 60-day transition to a fully virtual format. 

As producers, we became instant experts in virtual event execution, rapidly making a new platform viable to keep the event alive. This monumental effort resulted in an astonishing 14,000 people tuning in. The 3-day summit was produced across three time zones, running for 18 hours per day, and featured 280 speakers, comprehensive workshops, and even virtualized exhibits, demonstrating unparalleled resilience and global reach.
